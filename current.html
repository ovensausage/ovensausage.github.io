    <h2>What is Python</h2>
    <p>Python is a high-level general-purpose programming language. It has many features, which make it suitable for many different tasks. Python is designed to be highly readable and maintainable. It is also fast, and very easy to write programs in.

Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language that lets you work with the data in your computer in a clear and intuitive way. It has modules (packages) for text processing, numerical processing, and for accessing databases such as SQLite3. Python also comes with many facilities for interacting with the outside world: you can use it to send email or post messages on bulletin boards; or browse the Web or control hardware via serial ports or I/O ports.</p>
